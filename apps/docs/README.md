Anyon is a platform that allows Steam users to turn their skins/items into NFTs on the Solana blockchain. This allows efficient and decentralized p2p trading, allowing users to sell their skins for $SOL or $USDC. Anyon provides a secure and reliable way for Steam users to monetize their in-game items, as you cannot withdraw money using the Steam marketplace. With Anyon, users can easily wrap their Steam items in NFTs and then trade them directly with other users without the need for a middleman. This ensures that the trade is executed quickly and at a fair price.

### Why Anyon

The major issue with the current Steam market is that funds from a sale cannot be withdrawn, leaving them tied up in the account. While there are third-party sites available for selling items, they often offer prices below the market value to account for their own profit margin when reselling.

Even though the steam market sucks, another option for selling skins is on Chinese P2P websites, where most of the CSGO skins market liquidity outside of Steam is concentrated. However, the problem is that money can only be withdrawn via Alipay.

With Anyon, users can avoid these limitations. The platform allows P2P sales or trading on decentralized marketplaces like ME and Tensor using $SOL or $USDC, and then users can get a fair price by listing the skins on a decentralized marketplaces and easily withdraw their earnings without the need for a middleman.

### How it will works

The user will transfer the skin to our Steam escrow, and then a new NFT of that skin will be minted on the Solana blockchain. Once minted, the user can trade the NFT in any way they choose, using our marketplace or any other Solana marketplace, as long as the item is part of a collection.

To unwrap and redeem the item back to a Steam account, the item itself needs to be unlocked (after 7 days since the last wrap) and then the user will burn this NFT and the respective item will be sent from our Steam escrow to the user's Steam.

Also, once wrapped, the user will be able to sell the NFT for $SOL or $USDC and will be listed in marketplaces like MagicEden, Tensor, Hyperspace etc...
