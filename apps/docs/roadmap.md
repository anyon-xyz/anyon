Our MVP was submitted to the Solana hackathon to showcase our product and market. It included key features like wrapping Steam items into NFTs, listing those NFTs in major marketplaces, and other things that you can check in [docs](./README.md)

During the beta phase, our aim is to enhance the MVP, complete the platform's core, and introduce it to the public to evaluate its market fit.

Features expected at beta launch.
  * Anyon landing page
  * Wrap and Unwrap
  * Trading data dashboard (based on skins sold in the past)
  * Our own marketplace to buy/sell directly on the Anyon website
