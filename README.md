A platform for wrapping Steam skins into NFTs on the Solana blockchain

The goal is to take out centralized resale sites of skins that buy at prices far below the market and keep it up to you since you cant sell it for money outside of steam. You can now wrap and sell your item for SOL, USDC or any spl token.

## How it will works

For wrapping in NFT, the user will transfer his item to our Steam escrow, then will get a link to mint that NFT

To get the item back to your Steam, the item itself needs to be unlocked (after 7 days since the last trade) and then the user will burn this NFT and we will send the item from our Steam escrow to the user's Steam.

Also, once wrapped, the user will be able to sell the NFT for SOL/USDC and will be listed in marketplaces like MagicEden and Hyperspace.



## Mvp goals
  * Wrap and unwrap csgo skins
  * List wrapped skins in solana marketplaces
  * Images tags - locked or unlocked - 7d after the wrap
  
## Ideas
  * Build our own marketplace inside the app for better user experience
  * Update image tag using [Clockwork](https://www.clockwork.xyz/)
