A platform for wrapping Steam skins into NFTs on the Solana blockchain

The goal is to take out centralized resale sites of skins that buy at prices far below the market and keep it up to you. You can now wrap and sell your Steam item for SOL or USDC.

## How it will works

For wrapping in NFT, the user will transfer his item to our Steam escrow, then will get a link to mint that NFT

To get the item back to your Steam, the item itself needs to be unlocked (after 7 days since the last trade) and then the user will burn this NFT and we will send the item from our Steam escrow to the user's Steam.

Also, once wrapped, the user will be able to sell the NFT for SOL/USDC and will be listed in marketplaces like MagicEden and Hyperspace.
