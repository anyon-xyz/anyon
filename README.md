A platform for wrapping Steam skins into NFTs on the Solana blockchain

## Running locally

- Create and fill `.env` file. See `.env.example`

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build -d
$ yarn dev
```


## How it will works
  - Wrapping - The user will transfer their item to our Steam escrow and then mint a new NFT for that item

  - Unwrapping - To get the item back to your Steam account, the item needs to be unlocked (after 7 days since wrapped) and then the user will burn this NFT and we will send the item from our Steam escrow to the user's Steam.

Also, once wrapped, the user will be able to sell the NFT for SOL/USDC and will be listed in marketplaces like MagicEden and Hyperspace.

## Mvp goals
  - Wrap and unwrap csgo skins
  - List wrapped skins in solana marketplaces
  - Images tags or attributes - locked  unlocked - 7d after the wrap
  
## Ideas
  - Build our own marketplace inside the app for better user experience
  - Create image tags (locked/unlocked) and update using [Clockwork](https://www.clockwork.xyz/)
  - Fractionelized NFT Item eg. 100 Dragon lore NFT = 1 Dragon Lore
