A platform for wrapping Steam skins into NFTs on the Solana blockchain

## Running locally

- Create and fill `.env` file. See `.env.example`

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build -d
$ yarn build
$ yarn dev
```

## How it will works
  - Wrapping - The user will transfer their item to our Steam escrow and then mint a new NFT for that item

  - Unwrapping - To get the item back to your Steam account, the item needs to be unlocked (after 7 days since wrapped) and then the user will burn this NFT and then the user will burn this NFT and the respective item will be sent from our Steam escrow to the user's Steam.

Also, once wrapped, the user will be able to sell the NFT for SOL/USDC (even if the item is locked) and the collection for that item will be listed in marketplaces like MagicEden and Hyperspace.

## Mvp goals
  - Wrap and unwrap csgo skins
  - List wrapped skins in solana marketplaces
  - Images tags or attributes - locked/unlocked - 7d since the last wrap
  
## Ideas
  - Build our own marketplace inside the app for better user experience and enable p2p trades.
  - Create image tags (locked/unlocked) and update using [Clockwork](https://www.clockwork.xyz/)
  - Fractionelized NFT Item eg. 100 Dragon lore NFT = 1 Dragon Lore
